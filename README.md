## Description

Junior freelance developer hired to refactor a client's website. 

Horiseon is a leading digital marketing agency. They provide multiple services to clients looking to improve their digital imagery.

They reached out to me looking to make their code more concise and less cluttered. I was able to reduce their code by a few dozen lines and make sure their links on their navigation bar were working correctly.

## Usage
